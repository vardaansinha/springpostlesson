- Addon 1 - We added styling and a bigger business to make the game more fast paced and fluid. we also made the game more cometitive by adding a time limit, requiring players to react fast. We also added a cookie to save the player's score. Attempted to add reset button.
- Addon 2 - We added a database as per requirements which allows you to search up a company and purchase it, bringing in even more cash. We also implemented a money-per-second counter to allow the user to keep track of how much they earn. Used the player's score to add a message determining whether you beat your previous score or lost.
