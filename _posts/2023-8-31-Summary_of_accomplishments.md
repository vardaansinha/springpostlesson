## Summary of my accomplishments
- Day 1: I had absolutely no idea what I was doing. But after collaborating with my group to help me out, I finally got the guidance I need.
- Day 2: I started working on my project (aka my website), I had absolutely no idea what was going on. I encountered a bunch of errors
- Day 3: Still had no idea what I was doing. I had to spend the weekends to figure out some of my errors.
- Day 4: Finally got the website to work along with a theme
- Day 5: Tried to polish up everything in my website to get ready for the live review. Added a calculator along with some javascript to make stuff look good
- Day 6/7/8: STRESSED for my live review, because I never did it before. After finishing it, I was relieved after doing well
- Day 9: Polished the website a bit more, removed some of the pages to set up a lab notebook
- Day 10: looked at all of the hacks and did everything I can. Plus I added some java code that I made for a shopping simulation at a made up restaurant (IN-GET-OUT).
- Day 11: I made a guess the number game which is kind of like higher or lower, but allows more attempts.
- Day 12: Orlando and I are in progress of a java game. We brainstormed it very carefully. What we currently have down below. Not entirely finished, but we did brainstorm a lot on how this project will go.
```java
import java.util.*;
public class Adventure_Capitalist {
    String Item;
    Integer price;
    Integer Price;
    public Adventure_Capitalist(String item, Integer cost, Integer purchase_number){
        item = Item;
        cost = price;
        purchase_number = Price;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Adventure_Capitalist lemonade = new Adventure_Capitalist("lemonade", 1,0);        Adventure_Capitalist lemonade = new Adventure_Capitalist("lemonade", 1);       Adventure_Capitalist lemonade = new Adventure_Capitalist("lemonade", 1);
        Adventure_Capitalist pen  = new Adventure_Capitalist("pen", 10, 20);
        Adventure_Capitalist car = new Adventure_Capitalist("car", 10000, 20000);
        Adventure_Capitalist Scooters = new Adventure_Capitalist("Scooters", 500,1000);
        System.out.println("Welcome to Adventure Capitalist!");
        System.out.println("You have 3 minutes");
        
    }
}
```
