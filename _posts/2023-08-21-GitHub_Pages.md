### PBL Sprint 0 / Week 0
Learning outcome. Building a personal and running GitHub Pages.
- Monday: Live review of Tools and GitHub.
- Tuesday through Thursday: Tech Talks and work.
- Wednesday: Code, Code, Coding

### My progress:
Here was my progress:
- Making a github page was challenging at first. Despite having experience in linux, python, and html before, I wasn't that familiar with the md files and I spent some time struggling on running all the commands
- I did have to ask some of my teammates during class to help me fix some errors I encountered. Sometimes, it was just me not saving the file without knowing it.
- Some errors were like making blog pages, for example, when I was trying to make my calculator, some problems I encountered were not having the desired status I need and sometimes I have to ask Chatgpt or stackoverflow for advice on how I can create certain standards for each part of my calculator. As a result, it would look like what a normal scientific calculator would look like.
- For some reason it took me so long for my github pages to update
