    "\n",
    "- **Overview of Databases**: \n",
    "  - Databases are essential in storing, retrieving, and managing data.\n",
    "  - They support a range of data types and structures, from simple to complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Need for Storing Complex Data**:\n",
    "  - Modern applications often require the storage of nested, non-uniform data.\n",
    "  - Traditional database structures can be limiting when dealing with dynamic or hierarchical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## JSONB\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What is JSONB?**\n",
    "  - JSONB is a binary format of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).\n",
    "  - It allows for efficient storage of JSON data in SQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Advantages Over Traditional JSON**:\n",
    "  - **Performance**: JSONB stores data in a decomposed binary format, offering faster read and write operations compared to standard JSON.\n",
    "  - **Flexibility**: Allows for the storage of nested structures and arrays, accommodating complex data schemas.\n",
    "  - **Query Efficiency**: Provides the ability to perform complex queries directly on the JSONB fields.\n",
    "  - **Dynamic Schema**: Eliminates the need for schema modifications when the structure of the stored data changes."
