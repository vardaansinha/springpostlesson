Then, there will be the algorithm that needs to be implemented, which you can likely figure out from the problem and code blobs it provides for you."

However, you should remember the common wrapper classes - integer, double, boolean, character, etc. Furthermore, make sure that you don't unnecessarily use autoboxing/unboxing. You want your code to be as efficient and as object-oriented as possible, so make sure you are only autoboxing when you need to.\n"
