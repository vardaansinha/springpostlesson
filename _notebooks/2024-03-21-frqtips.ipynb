However, you should remember the common wrapper classes - integer, double, boolean, character, etc. Furthermore, make sure that you don't unnecessarily use autoboxing/unboxing. You want your code to be as efficient and as object-oriented as possible, so make sure you are only autoboxing when you need to.\n"
